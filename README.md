## Game Rules
* **Codebreaker** is a logic game in which a code-breaker tries to break a **secret code** created by a code-maker. The **codemaker**, which will be played by the application weâ€™re going to write, creates a secret code of **four numbers** between **1 and 6**.
* The codebreaker **gets** some number of chances to break the code (depends on chosen difficulty). In each turn, the **codebreaker** makes a guess of **4** numbers. The **codemaker** then marks the guess with up to 4 signs - **+** or - or **empty spaces**.
* A **+** indicates an exact match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code and in the same position. For example:
Secret number - 1234
Input number - 6264
Number of pluses - 2 (second and fourth position)
* A **-** indicates a number match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code but in a different position. For example:
**Secret number** - 1234
**Input number** - 6462
**Number of minuses** - 2 (second and fourth position)
* An empty space indicates that there is not a current digit in a secret number.
* If codebreaker inputs the **exact number** as a secret number - codebreaker **wins** the game. If all attempts are spent - codebreaker **loses**.
* **Codebreaker** also has some number of **hints**(depends on chosen difficulty). If a user takes a hint - he receives back a separate digit of the secret code.
